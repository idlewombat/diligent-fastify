# Fastify Application with Route Definitions and JSON Schema Validation

This Fastify application defines API routes and includes JSON schema validation for various components of the requests, such as route parameters, query parameters, and request bodies. This setup ensures robust data validation, makes the API requirements clearer, and facilitates potential code generation in client-server interactions.

---

## Type Definitions

### `PostPetsRoute`

Defines the structure of the request body for the `/api/pets` route. This route expects a pet object with `name` and `kind`, where `kind` is restricted to either "cat" or "dog."

```typescript
type PostPetsRoute = {
  Body: { name: string; kind: "cat" | "dog" };
};
```

### `PostBeveragesRoute`

Defines the structure of the `/api/beverages/:drink` route, including parameters, querystring, and response shape. This structure defines constraints on the allowed parameters and potential query options, allowing for more predictable request and response handling.

```typescript
type PostBeveragesRoute = {
  Params: {
    drink: "coffee" | "tea" | "chai";
  };
  Querystring: {
    milk?: "yes" | "no";
    sugar?: "yes" | "no";
  };
  Body: {
    kind: string;
  };
  Reply: {
    drink: string;
    with: string[];
  };
};
```

---

## JSON Schema Definitions

These schemas provide validation rules for incoming data in the `/api/beverages/:drink` endpoint, ensuring each part of the request matches the expected shape and data types.

### `beverageParamsSchema`

Defines the valid values for the `drink` parameter in the `/api/beverages/:drink` route. The `drink` parameter can be one of `"tea"`, `"coffee"`, or `"chai"`. This constraint helps prevent unexpected or unsupported values for the route.

```javascript
const beverageParamsSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    drink: { enum: ["tea", "coffee", "chai"] },
  },
  required: ["drink"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};
```

### `beverageQuerySchema`

Specifies the validation rules for the query parameters of the `/api/beverages/:drink` route. Both `milk` and `sugar` values are limited to `"yes"` or `"no"`, creating a predictable input range for these options.

```javascript
const beverageQuerySchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    milk: { enum: ["yes", "no"] },
    sugar: { enum: ["yes", "no"] },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
};
```

### `beverageBodySchema`

Defines the validation for the request body, ensuring that `kind` is provided as a string. This schema is useful for customizing the beverage type in the `/api/beverages/:drink` route.

```javascript
const beverageBodySchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    kind: { type: "string" },
  },
  required: ["kind"],
  additionalProperties: false,
};
```

## Application Setup

The application utilizes Fastify to define endpoints and applies JSON schema validation to enforce rules for each route. These routes include basic responses as well as validation-enforced routes that only accept specific parameter and query values.

```typescript
import fastify from "fastify";

export default function createApp(options = {}) {
  const app = fastify(options);

  // Basic greeting route
  app.get("/api/hello", (request, reply) => {
    reply.send({ hello: "World!" });
  });

  // Basic route for posting a pet
  app.post<PostPetsRoute>("/api/pets", (request, reply) => {
    const pet = request.body;
  });

  // Beverage route with schema validation
  app.post<PostBeveragesRoute>(
    "/api/beverages/:drink",
    {
      schema: {
        params: beverageParamsSchema,
        querystring: beverageQuerySchema,
        body: beverageBodySchema,
      },
    },
    (request, reply) => {
      const { drink } = request.params;
      const { milk, sugar } = request.query;
      const { kind } = request.body;

      // Process the 'with' array based on the query
      let with_ = [];
      if (milk === "yes") with_.push("milk");
      if (sugar === "yes") with_.push("sugar");

      reply.status(201).send({ drink: `${kind} ${drink}`, with: with_ });
    }
  );

  return app;
}
```

## Benefits of JSON Schema Validation

1. **Validation**: By ensuring incoming data matches the expected types and structure, JSON schema validation helps prevent malformed or unexpected inputs, leading to more robust error handling.
2. **Documentation**: JSON schemas act as in-line documentation for the API requirements, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the API.
3. **Automatic Code Generation**: Many tools can utilize JSON schemas to automatically generate client or server code, such as TypeScript types or API clients. This reduces boilerplate code and ensures consistency.
4. **Data Transformation**: Schemas also aid in transforming incoming data to the expected structure before it is processed in route handlers, simplifying data handling in the application.
